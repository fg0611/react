# üöÄ LinkedIn Web Scraping Project

This project extracts job opportunities from LinkedIn using Python and Selenium. It simulates human browsing by performing scrolling and random timeouts, leveraging various Selenium options to achieve its goal.

üí° **Tip:** I recommend using Anaconda for easier setup. This project is developed on Windows 11 with Python 3.9.21.

A Jupyter notebook is included for data wrangling to filter and sort positions. This project is still under construction, and more features will be added.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

```bash
# Create a Python 3.9.21 virtual environment named linkedin_scrapper
conda create --name linkedin_scrapper python=3.9.21

# List all conda environments
conda env list

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate linkedin_scrapper

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Navigate to the project root directory and run the following command with the environment active:

```bash
python main.py
```
